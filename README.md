<h2>Third Milestone Project: Data Centric Development - Code Institute</h2>

<h2 id="UserStories">User Stories</h1>

<p>I contacted 3 of my friends that have a keen interest in quizzes and all things Irish.</p>

<h3>Damien and Julie from Kingsbury</h3>
<p>..........</p>

<h3>Susan and John from Ballina</h3>
<p>..........</p>

<h3>Darren and Eimear from Melbourne</h3>
<p>...........</p>

<h2 id="Strategy">Strategy</h2>
<p>The overall strategy for visitors to this website is...  My goal in the design of this website is to make it easy to navigate and use, easy on the eye.
As soon as you open the website you will see an image of Quiz Time which I find is eye catching.... 
I designed the logo on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freelogodesign.org/">www.freelogodesign.org</a> and 
chose a subtle green, white and orange as these are the colours of Irish flag. 
I used <a target="_blank" href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">www.color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel</a>
and selected the logo image and this website picked out distinct colours from the image and used only three of 
these colours consistently throughout the website so as not to overpower the website with too many colours. The 
colours selected were XXX. For the Contact Us section, I used 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hex-to-rgb.html">www.rapidtables.com</a> to convert hex #718C0F 
to RGB colour in order to use transparency to see the background image. I have used <a target="_blank" 
href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> to select the 2 different fonts used in the website. I chose 
xxx font for the 
main headings as it compliments the Logo font. I also chose xxx font for the main scripting as it is a good pairing
with xxx font as per the google font website.</p>

<h2>Navbar</h2>
I have used a responsive navigation bar using materialize. On the left is the logo. 
For mobile devices a hamburger menu on the top-left expands a menu with links to 
the different section on the website. On larger devices the expanded menu is shown 
instead. I feel this will be easy for users to quickly navigate the website. This 
navbar will be fixed for easy navigation.

<h2>Card</h2>
....................

<h2>Modal</h2>
....................


<h2>Contact Form and EmailJS</h2>
Included a contact form with 3 required fields (name, email and query 
that when completed correctly will send an email to myself and an auto reply email
to the sender using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.emailjs.com/">EmailJS</a>. If one or more of
the fields are not completed correctly, website visitor will be advised.

### Validation
I used validator websites to test the following:

* HTML - <a target="_blank" href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Html Checker</a> - 32 minor errors found - all corrected
* JavaScript - <a target="_blank" href="https://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> 
    * **maps.js** 5 warnings - 2 corrected (missing ; and + on line 157), other 3 are minor warnings of which 2 relate to old browsers such as IE 9 or below, seldomly used 
    * **script.js** 0 warnings
    * **sendEmail.js** 0 warnings


* CSS - <a target="_blank" href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input">W3C CSS Checker</a> - 2 minor errors found - all corrected
<p>
    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
            alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>
</p>

When I right clicked inspect, XX warnings appeared. Minor warnings all related to image of map markers with lettering - "was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image".

### Responsiveness
<p>I tested the responsiveness of the website on google chrome by using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.responsinator.com/">www.responsinator.com</a>. I also used the 
the inspect by right clicking over the website and then going into the toggle device toolbar. I selected the most used devices to also test for 
responsiveness i.e. Galaxy S5, iPhone 5/SE/6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 plus, iPhone X, iPad and iPad Pro.</p>

### Navbar
All links tested and working correctly. 

### Website and Social Media links
All links for websites and social media in About section, top 4 recommendations section and footer section all working correctly
on all devices and browsers and opened under a new tab leaving Donegal Town Destination tab open.
  
### Contact Us
Contact Us working correctly. I tried to submit an empty form and verified that an error message about the 
required fields appears. Tried to submit the form with an invalid email address without an @ and verified 
that a relevant error message appears. Tried to submit the form with only 1 field correctly entered, then 
2 fields correctly and then 3 fields correctly entered  and verified that a relevant error message appears
for the remaining fileds left blank.

### EmailJS
When form fully completed correctly, I have checked that an email will be sent to my email address with all information
given and also an automatic email will be sent the the email address entered in the form to say "Hi 'fname' Thank you
for completing the contact form in the Destination Donegal Town website. We will reply to you within 24 hours. 
Kinds Regards, Destination Donegal Town."
